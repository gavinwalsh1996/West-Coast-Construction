<h1>Inspiration</h1>

After posting my portfolio online for feedback, I had lots of people mention that I didn't have enough projects within my portfolio website.
This was something I was aware of myself and wanted to add as many projects as possible to better my chances of finding a job. I realized that I was missing a simple web design of a generic company website as my current projects were more app/entertainment focused.

<h1>Summary</h1>

With this design, I spent a lot of time planning and gathering information from many different construction websites. In the end, I gathered most of my content (written information) from a live website and made the tweaks to make it my own. I felt that it was not worth my time coming up with all of the company information myself from scratch and could spend that time on more important tasks within my project. 

This project wasn't overly challenging for me because of it's simplicity but I defintely still learned a lot from it and improved my overall web development skills.
It also encouraged me to learn Tailwind CSS for my next project as I noticed that I spent a lot of time with stylesheets which really slowed down the process.
